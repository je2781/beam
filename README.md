Beam
=========

## development
I started with the project structure, and moved the routes into the (pages) folder. Authentication followed, with storing mock data in the login page. I later onto the wallet page, with all its components, while doing its responsiveness. Finally worked on the modals, with responsive as well.

For backend I started with integrating TypeORM with the entities, before creating services/controllers/modules for each entity. Tested the routes on postman successfully, and added authentication, and data validation.

## testing
Unit tests were done on all the page components, excluding UI components.

## How to run the app (frontend)

Run (npm run dev) from the main directory to compile for development. To test run (npm run test). 

## How to run the app (backend)
